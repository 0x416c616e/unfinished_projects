# Unfinished Projects

A list of my unfinished projects that I should work on. Please note: some of these are private at the moment.

**dotfiles**: a repo of dotfiles, such as .bashrc, .vimrc, and more. What I still need to do: upload my config files from my dell laptop, macbook, and desktop. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/dotfiles)

**software_book**: list of all code examples in my book about software. What I still need to do:  [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/software_book)

**Book markdown**: the markdown version of my book about software development. What I still need to do:  finish my book, then conver it to markdown, then upload the markdown chapters. One markdown file per chapter, each in a different folder, just like my security book. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/book_markdown)

**flashcards**: A simple flash card app. What I still need to do: convert my Anki flash cards to a MySQL database, then make the entire app, which will let you choose different decks I've already made, and then it will show you random questions from the deck (each deck is a database table) and then you can click again to view the answer. Shows random cards. This will be a LAMP stack project. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/flashcards)

**csfactsbot**: A Twitter bot that tweets out computer science facts. What I still need to do: come up with a list of computer science facts, then put them as JSON or lines in a text file or something, then make a Python script that randomly chooses one fact, then tweets it out using Tweepy.  [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/csfactsbot)

**BadExif**: Exif security tool. It lets you put PHP code in images. It currently just has a couple example images that have PHP in them already. What I still need to do: make it so you can choose which image to use, and what PHP code you want to be put into the file. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/badexif)

**Keylogger.js**: a JS-based keylogger. What I still need to do: make the keylogger. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/keyloggerjs)

**Cookie Stealer**: A JS-based cookie stealer for use against sites with XSS vulnerabilities. What I still need to do: make the cookie stealer JS. It's very simple. It should make an <img> tag request to example.com/image.jpg?cookie=document.cookie or something like that. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/cookiestealer)

**Rootkit Finder**: A basic tool for finding rootkits and other suspicious things in Linux. What I still need to do: finish stuff for the remaining forms of task scheduling, add the ability to log output, and possibly actually check the output rather than merely listing it. Also needs ability to check history of non-root users. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/rootkit_finder)

**CVE Alerter**: A PHP project which lets you input software to keep track of. When there's a new CVE for it, it will alert you via email. What I still need to do: everything. I will need to make a LAMP VM on one of my hypervisors, then start working on this. It will need to use a CVE API. It will also need to use PHP to email the user. I haven't really started this project yet. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/CVE_Alerter)

**Dice Roller**: A browser extension that lets you roll dice. What I still need to do: just finish the "custom" roll feature, make it look nicer with CSS, and then submit it to Firefox. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/dice_roller)

**Message board**: A Full stack LAMP message board project. What I still need to do: everything. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/messageboard)

**Text RPG**: A simple command line RPG written in Java. What I still need to do: everything. I was thinking about using a 2D array for the map. The map is an object from the map class, and it has many tile objects. The player is an object from a singleton class. When you move, you are changing the player's x,y "location" which determines what you do on the map. There will be basic stuff like enemies, shops, quests, etc. Just a good way to get more experience with using lots of classes instead of more basic procedural-esque programming. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/textrpg)

**Book Resources**: All of the websites, apps, and books I recommend in my book about software development, all in a single repo. What I still need to do: finish the book, and then look through it and put all of the websites, software, and books in this list. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/book_resources)

**Static Site Generator**: A static site generator written in Python. What I still need to do: you can currently make a project and write articles. But you need to be able to do the find-and-replace thing to put articles into article page templates, and also do pagination for the pages of truncated articles, like maybe 5 articles per page. You only see the title, image, and maybe the first paragraph in these article list pages. When you click on them, you're taken to the full article.  [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/staticsitegenerator)

**SQL learning**: a repo of notes on learning SQL. What I still need to do: convert my CS315 database stuff to this repo. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/sql_learning)

**Data Aggregator**: Aggregates financial data from a number of sources. What I still need to do: use Yahoo Finance or the Bloomberg Open API or whatever in order to aggregate financial data from numerous sources. Should be able to track stocks or bonds over time. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/sfrdataaggregator)

**Abyss Dropper**: A multi-stage payload dropper. What I still need to do: everything aside from the logo. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/abyssdropper)

**Chicagoland Software**: My new website. What I still need to do: server, SSL, layout, logo, content, etc. It wil be like a more updated version of my old Saint Louis Software website. The blog should use SSG, and the projects section should have a more up-to-date list of my GitHub projects. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/chicagolandsoftware)

**amp4mac**: Like my AMP script, but for macOS. What I still need to do: change apt-get to brew, and test it and make sure it works on my MacBook. List all dependencies. [Link](https://github.com/0x416c616e/amp4mac)

**AutoAMP**: A visual tool for running different things that I have in my AMP script, such as installing software updates, running a virus scan, etc. What I still need to do: use some sort of subprocess-esque thing and create lambda expression event handlers for the buttons so that the buttons do stuff and also make it so that the output of the subprocess shell commands gets shown in the scrollable text area in the window. Maybe also dial back some of my overly ambitious features for it. Just make it simple. It's just a graphical way to do routine Linux tasks, by clicking buttons instead of running a shell script.
